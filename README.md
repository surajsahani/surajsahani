  <summary markdown="span">👀 Here's some trivia about me: </summary>
     Here's some trivia about me:

     * I am impacient and I do not ask for permission. I turn ideas into actionable items and I will make sure you are involved.
     * I enjoy receiving public praise, but private praise fuels me.
     * I can think about things from an engineer's mindset.
     * I am strong with program planning and documentation. I **love** taking notes during meetings. ✍️
     * I have a strong sense of ownership when it comes to work. Related to that, I do not like inefficiency and will look for any way to improve that.
     * I value stability and predictablity - I hate feeling uncomfortable. Sometimes I can react negatively to change but I do my best to embrace it and keep a positive mindset. I recognize that growing means feeling uncomfortable.
     * English is not my native language which can affect how I verbally express myself. I experience a lot of non-linear thinking in a mixture of Assamese and English, which reflects in my choice of words or sentence structure. In other words, I think as I speak.
     * I'm a sports enthusiast. , I have always been a creator. Altought I am extremely fulfilled, I'd still like to experiment with a different career in the future.
     * Prior to Android, I was an QA Engineer testing  very first android application codebase. That experience shaped me into the person and professional I am today. 
     * All those years working as a assurance engineer gave me a _pixel-perfect_ awareness. It's both a blessing and a curse.
     * As engineer, I am responsible for the product as a whole. You will see me involved in many, many different fronts: from process to hands-on coding.
     * I prototype low-fidelity first. You will not see me delivering bug free application until they are required in the development process. I prefer to gather ideas and work on them in words before delivering any "application".
